{"id": "CW0002", "response": "The correct answer is D) \u201cGurs\u201d etib yiqildi.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- \"Gurs\" is the subject of the sentence, so it should be enclosed in quotation marks to indicate it's a specific object or place.\n- \"yetib\" and \"etib\" both mean \"arriving\", but \"yetib\" is in the imperfective aspect (continuous action) and \"etib\" is in the perfective aspect (completed action). Since the sentence implies a completed action, \"etib\" is more appropriate.\n- \"yliqildi\" is the third-person singular past passive form of the verb \"liqilmoq\" (to fall), which matches the subject \"Gurs\".\n\nSo, the correct sentence should read: \"\u201cGurs\u201d etib yiqildi\".", "extracted_answer": "D"}

{"id": "CW0195", "response": "A) Jalyuzi pardalar\n\nThe correct option is A) \"Jalyuzi pardalar\". In Uzbek, \"jalyuzi\" is a noun, and it is usually accompanied by a plural suffix \"-lar\" to indicate multiple items. Therefore, the correct spelling is \"Jalyuzi pardalar\".\n\nOption B) \"Jalyuza pardalar\" is incorrect because \"jalyuza\" is not a valid form of \"jalyuzi\" in Uzbek.

{"id": "CW0201", "response": "B) Kamina misol aytdi.\n\nExplanation: The sentence in option A, \"Kamina misol aytdim,\" is incorrect because it uses the 1st person singular tense (-dim) instead of the 3rd person singular masculine tense (-di) for the verb \"aytdi\" (said). Option C and D are general statements that do not refer to a specific sentence, so they cannot be considered as right or wrong answers to this question.

{"id": "CW0208", "response": "The correct answer is B) Ko'ynak.\n\nExplanation:\n- \"Ko'ylak\" means \"suit\" in Uzbek, which is not the correct word for a pocket.\n- \"Ko'ynak\" is the correct Uzbek word for a pocket, as it refers to an opening in clothing to hold something.\n- \"Ikkovi ham to'g'ri\" means \"both are correct,\" but since only one option (B) is the correct word for a pocket, this statement is incorrect.\n- \"Ikkovi ham xato\" means \"both are incorrect,\" which is not applicable since only option A is incorrect.", "extracted_answer": "B"}

The words \"kuzirlik\" and \"kuzurlik\" both mean \"sin\" or \"fault\" in the Uzbek language, and the imperative form \"-ma\" is used to form commands in Uzbek.

{"id": "CW0223", "response": "The correct answer is C) Ikkovi ham to\u2018g\u2018ri (Both are correct).\n\nHere's why:\n\n- \"Mana bu\" is a colloquial way of saying \"This is it\" or \"Here it is\".\n- \"Manavi\" means \"myself\" or \"I\".\n\nBoth phrases are grammatically correct and have different meanings.", "extracted_answer": "C"}
{"id": "CW0224", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. In each option, identify the part of speech that \"Mana\" and \"bu\" represent.\n2. In option A, \"Mana\" is a relative pronoun indicating \"which\" or \"that\", and \"bu\" is an adverb of place. Combining them, the phrase can be translated as \"This is that one\". However, as there is no mention of any specific object to refer to, it is not grammatically correct.\n3. Option B, \"Manavi\", is incorrect because it is not a standard way to combine \"Mana\" and \"bu\" in Turkish. \"Manavi\" does not have a specific meaning in Turkish.\n4. Option C, \"Ikkovi ham to\u2018g\u2018ri\", suggests that both options A and B are correct, which is incorrect as we have already determined that option B is not a correct usage of Turkish.\n5.

However, the English word \"Manbaa\" is not a standard English word. It seems like a mixture of Arabic and English, where \"Manba\" means \"source\" in Arabic. If we are to assume that \"Manbaa\" is an attempt to write \"Manba\" with a long vowel mark, then it would be correct in Arabic, but not in English.

{"id": "CW0251", "response": "The correct answer is B) Nuqtayi nazar.\n\nExplanation:\n- \"Nuqtai nazar\" is incorrect because it lacks the \"y\" after the \"t\".\n- \"Nuqtayi nazar\" is correct as it means \"viewpoint\" in English.\n- \"Ikkovi ham to\u2018g\u2018ri\" is incorrect because it suggests that both options A and B are correct, which is not the case.\n- \"Ikkovi ham xato\" is incorrect as it suggests that both options A and B are incorrect, which is also not the case, as only one is incorrect.", "extracted_answer": "B"}
{"id": "CW0252", "response": "The correct answer is C) Ikkovi ham to\u2018g\u2018ri (Both are correct).\n\nThe phrase \"Nur ustiga a\u02bclo nur\" means \"a superior light on top of light\" or \"the light of all lights\", while \"Nur ustiga nur\" means \"light on top of light\".

{"id": "CW0253", "response": "A) Nur ustiga nur\n\nExplanation: The phrase \"Nur ustiga nur\" means \"Light upon light\" in English. This is a correct phrase in Uzbek language. The other options are incorrect because they do not form proper phrases in Uzbek.", "extracted_answer": "A"}

{"id": "CW0265", "response": "The correct spelling in the options given is:\nA) Oson\n\nSo, the answer is (A).\n\nThe word \"on\" means \"one\" in English, and adding \"son\" to it would make \"onson\", which is not a standard Uzbek word. \"Oson\" means \"easy\" in English. The other options are incorrect because \"on\" is not a part of the standard Uzbek vocabulary.", "extracted_answer": "A"}
{"id": "CW0266", "response": "The correct answer is D) Ikkovi ham xato (Both are wrong).\n\nHere's why:\n- \"Oson\" means \"easy\" in Uzbek, so \"Oson savol\" should be \"Easy question\".\n- \"Onson\" is not a valid word in Uzbek, so \"Onson savol\" is not a correct phrase.\n\nTherefore, both options A and B are incorrect.", "extracted_answer": "D"}

The correct phrase should be \"oyoqi osti kiritdi\" or \"oyoqini ostiga kiritdi\" which means \"put it under the foot\".\n\nSo, neither A) Oyoqosti qildi nor B) Oyog\u02bbosti qildi is correct. Therefore, both options A and B are wrong (ikkovi ham xato - both are wrong).", "extracted_answer": "D"}
{"id": "CW0269", "response": "The correct spelling among the given options is A) Oyoqosti qilma!.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n- \"Oyoqosti\" is the gerund form of the verb \"oyoq seluruhish\" (to fully stretch one's legs).\n- \"Qilma\" is the imperative negative form of the verb \"qilmoq\" (to do).\n\nSo, the sentence means \"Don't stretch your legs!\"", "extracted_answer": "A"}
{"id": "CW0270", "response": "The correct spelling is \"Oziqa\". Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA) Oziqa\n\nThe word \"Ozuqa\" is not a standard term in Uzbek language, and \"Ikkovi ham to\u2018g\u2018ri\" or \"Ikkovi ham xato\" are not relevant statements in this context.", "extracted_answer": "A"}
{"id": "CW0271", "response": "D) Ikkovi ham xato\n\nBoth \"Pachaq\" and \"Pachoq\" are misspelled forms of \"Pachuq,\" the proper spelling. Therefore, neither A nor B is correct, and the answer is D) Ikkovi ham xato (Both are wrong).", "extracted_answer": "D"}

It's a common expression used when inviting someone to have a meal together.\n\nOptions B (Pishshillamoq), C (Ikkovi ham to'g'ri - Both are correct), and D (Ikkovi ham xato - Both are incorrect) are incorrect.", "extracted_answer": "A"}
{"id": "CW0273", "response": "B) Piyozni archdi\n\nExplanation:\nThe phrase \"Piyozni archdi\" means \"She/He cut the onion.\" In this sentence, \"Piyozni\" is the direct object case of \"piyoz\" (onion), and \"archdi\" is the past tense of the verb \"archish\" (to cut). Therefore, option B is correct.\n\nOption A is incorrect because \"Piyozni archidi\" would mean \"May the onion be cut,\" using the imperative mood, which is not the same as the intended meaning.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it implies that both A and B are correct, which is not the case.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it states that both A and B are wrong, but B is actually correct.", "extracted_answer": "B"}

{"id": "CW0275", "response": "A) Poyafzal\n\nThe correct word is \"poyabzal,\" which means \"shoe\" in Uzbek. \"Poyafzal\" is not a correct word in the Uzbek language, so the correct answer is A) Poyafzal, as it is a mistake and not an accurate translation.", "extracted_answer": "A"}
{"id": "CW0276", "response": "The correct spelling is \"pul undurdi\" which means \"he spent the money\". \"Pul undirdi\" is not a correct form in Uzbek language. So, the correct answer is:\n\nB) Pul undurdi", "extracted_answer": "B"}
{"id": "CW0277", "response": "The correct answer is B) Pulni sovirmoq. Here's why:\n\nThe other options have errors:\n- A) Pulni sovurmoq: The suffix \"-urmoq\" is used to form the infinitive form of a verb, but in this case, it should be \"-irmoq\" because the root verb is \"sovirish\" (to stir or shake).\n- C) Ikkovi ham to\u2018g\u2018ri: This implies that both A and B are correct, which is not the case.\n- D) Ikkovi ham xato: This suggests that both A and B are incorrect, but as we've seen, B is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) Pulni sovirmoq.", "extracted_answer": "B"}
{"id": "CW0278", "response": "B) Futur yetmoq\n\nExplanation: \"Futur\" in this context is derived from the Latin word for future, \"futurus\". The suffix \"-moq\" added to a noun in Uzbek usually implies the action or the person doing that action. Therefore, \"Futur yetmoq\" can be translated as \"to foresee the future\" or \"to be a fortune teller\". The other options contain incorrect spellings and are not the correct answer.", "extracted_answer": "B"}

{"id": "CW0284", "response": "B) Qarindosh\n\nExplanation: Qarimdosh is not a correct word in Uzbek, so option A is incorrect. Qarindosh is the correct word for \"relative\" in Uzbek, so option B is correct. Option C (both are correct) is not possible because one of them is incorrect, and option D (both are incorrect) is also not possible because one of them is correct.

{"id": "CW0288", "response": "C) Ikkovi ham to\u2018g\u2018ri\n\nExplanation: Both variants are correct. \"Qaynana\" and \"Qaynona\" are two different ways of spelling the same word in Uzbek. So, both options A and B are correct. Therefore, the correct answer is C) Ikkovi ham to\u2018g\u2018ri, which means \"both are correct\" in Uzbek.", "extracted_answer": "C"}
{"id": "CW0289", "response": "The correct answer is B) Qaynota, qaynona.\n\nExplanation:\n- \"Qaynata\" is written with a \"y\" before \"ay\", which is incorrect. It should be \"qaynata\" (with a simple \"a\" after \"ayn\").\n- \"Qaynona\" is written with an \"o\" instead of \"a\" after \"ayn\", which is also incorrect. It should be \"qaynana\" (with an \"a\" after \"ayn\").\n- Therefore, the correct pairing is \"Qaynota\" (with a simple \"a\" after \"ayn\") and \"Qaynona\" (with an \"o\" after \"ayn\").\n\nSo, the only option that has both terms written correctly is B) Qaynota, qaynona.", "extracted_answer": "B"}

{"id": "CW0304", "response": "D) Ikkovi ham xato\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe correct form of the verb \"to turn\" in Turkish is \"dondurur\", not \"buradi\" or \"buradi\". Additionally, \"radio\" should be preceded by a possessive suffix when referring to a specific object, such as \"radionun\".

{"id": "CW0823", "response": "C) \u00abExpert\u00bb kompaniyasi\n\nExplanation: In Turkish, when a word starts with a vowel sound, it is preceded by a glottal stop (represented by '&#x25CC;' or '``' in Turkish), which is not typically written in English. Therefore, the correct spelling should include the glottal stop before \"Expert\", resulting in \u00abExpert\u00bb. Additionally, in Turkish, the possessive case is indicated by the suffix \"-s\u0131\" or \"-si\" at the end of the word, and since \"kompaniyasi\" is in the possessive case, it should be written as \u00abExpert\u00bb kompaniyas\u0131.

It's used to describe when or how something happens, similar to English \"right away\" or \"immediately\".\n\nSo, \"Fasllar kelinchaki\" means \"paragraphs immediately\" in English, which doesn't make much sense in this context.

Therefore, we can eliminate options A and B because they use the first and second person singular possessive suffixes, respectively.\n\nNow, between options C and D:\n\n- \"Oqavo suv\" uses the second person singular possessive suffix, which is not appropriate for this context, so we can eliminate option C.\n- \"Oqova suv\" uses the first person singular possessive suffix, which is not appropriate for this context, so we can eliminate option D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: \"Oqava suv.\"", "extracted_answer": "A"}

Therefore, it is often replaced with \"X\".\n* \"\u0441\" represents the sound \"s\" in Arabic.\n* \"\u043b\" represents the sound \"l\" in Arabic.\n* \"\u0430\" represents the sound \"a\" in Arabic.\n* \"\u0434\" represents the sound \"d\" in Arabic, which is often softened to \"t\" when followed by another consonant.

{"id": "FI0000", "response": "The correct answer is D) Eman. The riddle is a traditional poem that plays with word associations and puns. The first part says \"the tree's fallen \u2013 its shade is gone\", and the second part says \"the young man's happiness \u2013 his life is gone\". The word that fits the mask and completes the riddle with the same pattern would be something that has fallen and is no longer there. While the other options are types of trees, none of them fit the pattern of the poem as well as Eman. In this context, Eman means \"date palm\", and the phrase \"Eman daraxtining egilgani \u2013 singani\" implies that the date palm has fallen and its shade (fruit) is gone.", "extracted_answer": "D"}

{"id": "FI0003", "response": "B) Axalteke otlari\n\nExplanation: The sentence means \"The danger of horses getting lost.\" The suffix \"-ke\" in the Kazak language denotes a possessive form in the singular case.

The correct suffix to use to indicate 'from' in this context is \"-biri\", which is derived from \"-bir\", meaning 'some'. So, the correct prefix to match with \"-biri\" is \"g\u02bbo\u02bbla-\", which means 'tavern' in Uzbek.\n\nThus, the sentence should read: \"Qop-qora, semiz kishi og\u02bbir yurib, g\u02bbo\u02bblabirdan kelgan, davraga chiqdi.

Therefore, the correct term to fill in the blank is \"tegajog\u02bblik.\"\n\nSo, the completed sentence would be: \"Atay tegajog\u02bblik qilib, jahlini chiqarishga urinardi.\"", "extracted_answer": "B"}
{"id": "FI0009", "response": "The correct answer is D) qavug\u02bbi.\n\nIn Uzbek, the word \"baentlichek\" means \"bladder\" or \"balloon\" which is what this sentence is referring to.

{"id": "FI0013", "response": "C) Juma mavzusida\n\nExplanation:\nThe suffix \"-da\" in Uzbek indicates the location or place where an action takes place.

{"id": "FI0015", "response": "The correct answer is:\n\nC) qorong\u02bbu\n\nExplanation: The word \"qorong\u02bbi\" in Uzbek means \"darkness\". When we say \"Chiroq yana o\u02bbchdi.

{"id": "FI0018", "response": "The correct answer is D) chuqulab.\n\nThe verb in the sentence \"Eski radioni chuqur o'tirardi\" is \"o'tirardi\", which is in the past tense and indicates a past habit.

The correct variant that should be used in this context is:\n\n\"Eski radioni chuqulab o'tirardi.\"\n\nThe other options (A, B, and C) are not correct based on standard Uzbek grammar and orthography.", "extracted_answer": "D"}

The other options do not have the same meaning:\n\n- \"alg\u02bbov-dolg\u02bbov\" means \"jacket-pants\" or \"suit\"\n- \"ikkovi\" means \"both\" or \"both of them,\" which does not fit the context of the sentence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) alg\u02bbov-dalg\u02bbov.", "extracted_answer": "B"}

{"id": "FI0022", "response": "The correct answer is (A) sug\u02bburib.\n\nHere's why: the phrase \"yerning jigarini\" means \"the liver of the earth\" and implies that the earth is being treated in a certain way. The verb \"oladi\" means \"becomes\". So, we're looking for a word that can fit into the sentence \"When you work hard on it, the earth's liver **becomes** __________.\"\n\nThe suffix \"-ib\" is the converbial form of the verb \"sug'urmoq\" which means \"to resemble\" or \"to be like\". So, \"sug'urib\" means \"by being like\" or \"by resembling\".\n\nTherefore, the sentence means \"When you work hard on it, the earth's liver **resembles** __________.\" The missing word should describe a condition or state that the earth's liver enters when worked on diligently. Since none of the other options (B, C, D) fit grammatically or contextually, the correct answer is (A) sug\u02bburib.", "extracted_answer": "A"}
{"id": "FI0023", "response": "The correct answer is C) naxt.\n\nThe sentence \"Kecha mask shu vaqtda u dars qilayotgan edi\" means \"Yesterday at this time he was studying.\" The word \"mask\" is a typographical error, and it should be replaced with the word \"ma'mdu\", which means \"last night\".

{"id": "FI0024", "response": "The correct answer is B) nimkosa.\n\nExplanation:\n- The original phrase \"kosa tagida <mask>\" can be translated as \"whatever kind of <mask>\".\n- The word \"nimkosa\" is a composition of \"nim\" (what) and \"kosa\" (kind), which together mean \"what kind\".\n- Therefore, the complete phrase \"kosa tagida nimkosa\" translates to \"whatever kind of what kind\", which seems redundant but can be used to emphasize the questioning of the kind or type of something.\n- The other options provided (A, C, and D) are not grammatically correct in this context.", "extracted_answer": "B"}
{"id": "FI0025", "response": "C) probka\n\nExplanation: \"Mashina pr\u00f3bka da qolib ketdi\" translates to \"The machine stalled\". The word \"stettings bar\" (probka) means a bar that stops something. Therefore, the correct answer is C) probka.", "extracted_answer": "C"}

Both \"kesak\" and \"kessak\" are the reflexive forms of the verb \"kelmoq\" (to come), and in this context, they can both mean \"to come together\".\n\nSo, the sentence can be translated as:\n\"One for a thousand ravens to come together.\"", "extracted_answer": "C"}
{"id": "FI0027", "response": "The correct answer is A) yasharish.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- \"Navro'z\" is the Uzbek word for the spring equinox and the beginning of the year in the Uzbek calendar.\n- \"Bayrami\" means \"holiday\" in Uzbek.\n- \"Yasharish\" means \"to celebrate\" or \"celebration\" in Uzbek.\n\nSo, the phrase \"Navro'z yasharish bayrami\" means \"Navruz celebration holiday\".\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n- \"Yosharish\" is not a valid word in Uzbek.\n- \"Ikkovi ham to'g'ri\" and \"Ikkovi ham xato\" mean \"both are correct\" and \"both are wrong\" respectively, but they don't fit in the context of the sentence.", "extracted_answer": "A"}

Therefore, the most suitable option is:\n\nA) nazdida\n\nThe word \"nazdida\" in the Uighur language means \"in front of\" or \"before one's face\".

{"id": "FI0033", "response": "The correct answer is B) uzilish.\n\nThe sentence \"Orada ozgina <mask> bo\u2018ldi\" means \"Something small <mask> there\". The word \"uzilish\" means \"rupture\" or \"tear\", which can be used to describe a small break or damage. The other options are not grammatically correct:\n\n- \"uzulish\" is not a real word in Uzbek.\n- \"Ikkovi ham to\u2018g\u2018ri\" means \"Both are correct\", but in this context, it's not a suitable replacement for <mask>.\n- \"Ikkovi ham xato\" means \"Both are wrong\", which also doesn't fit the context.", "extracted_answer": "B"}
{"id": "FI0034", "response": "C) Ikkovi ham to\u2018g\u2018ri\n\nExplanation: The suffix \"-dil\" is used to form verbs from nouns in Uzbek, and it indicates the ability to do something. In this case, \"tuyoq\" means \"hoof\" and \"gul\" means \"flower\". The phrase \"otlarning tuyoqlari gullarni majaqladi\" means \"the horses' hooves crush the flowers\". The suffix \"-ladi\" at the end of the verb \"majaqladi\" indicates past tense. So, both options A) majaqladi and B) majag\u2018ladi are correct, but they are in different cases: A) is in the nominative case, and B) is in the instrumental case. Therefore, the answer is C) Ikkovi ham to\u2018g\u2018ri.", "extracted_answer": "C"}
{"id": "FI0035", "response": "The correct answer is A) urush.\n\nHere's why: The phrase \"ikki bola mushtlashdi\" means \"two people fought\". The verb \"mushtlash\" is used for physical fights. In this context, \"mask\" would mean something that covers the face, such as a mask. The closest translation for a face-to-face physical fight would be \"war\" or \"battle\" in English, which is \"urush\" in Uzbek. So, \"urush\" is the most appropriate word to fill in the blank. The other options (B) urish, and D) Ikkovi ham xato are not suitable for this context.", "extracted_answer": "A"}

{"id": "FI0037", "response": "C) Ikkovi ham to\u2018g\u2018ri\n\nExplanation: The word \"hammayoqni\" means \"all the legs.\" The verb \"qilibsizlar-ku\" is in the second person plural future indicative tense, which means \"you (plural) will do.\" The correct way to mask the word \"oyoq\" (leg) in this context is to use \"oyoqosti\" for the singular and \"oyoqlarosti\" for the plural.

{"id": "FI0038", "response": "The correct answer is (D) Ikkovi ham xato (Both are wrong). In the poem \"Muhabbatnoma\" by E. Vohidov, the word \"rangim\" (my color) is a metaphor for beauty or grace, and it is not used to describe a specific object or item. Therefore, neither \"kahrabo\" (walnut) nor \"qahrabo\" (mourning dove) would be appropriate replacements for the masked word. The poet is expressing the pain of love in a metaphorical way, and the masked word is not meant to be a literal object.

In Uzbek, the possessive form of nouns ending in \"-i\" is \"-ida\". So, \"fikringiz\" would be \"your opinion\" and \"xususida\" would be \"in your opinion\".
